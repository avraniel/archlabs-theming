This github gathers all the extra software and tweaking I like to do to my system.
Upon reinstallation it only takes a minimum of time to finetune my system again.
That is the goal.

I have to warn you. You can harm your computer if you do not know what you are running.
So please read the scripts the first time you run them. Open the destination folders and
see what happens.

Or experiment on virtualbox first.
